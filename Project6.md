# Flask API Project
## What is an API?
## Definition
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it as a messenger that takes requests and tells a system what you want to do, then returns the response back to you.

## Everyday Examples
* Weather Apps: When you check the weather on your phone, the app sends a request to a weather service API, which then sends back the weather data.
* Social Media Sharing: When you share a YouTube video on Facebook, an API allows Facebook to access the YouTube video data and display it on your timeline.
* Online Payments: When you buy something online, an API allows the online store to communicate with your bank to process the payment.

## Why Are APIs Important?
## Modularity
APIs allow different parts of a software system to be developed independently. For example, a mobile app can use an API to interact with a backend server without needing to know how the server works internally.

## Scalability
APIs make it easier to scale applications. You can add more servers or services that communicate via APIs without disrupting the existing system.

## Reusability
APIs enable the reuse of code and services across different applications. For example, a payment processing API can be used by multiple e-commerce websites.

## How Do APIs Work?
## Basic Components
* Request: The client (e.g., your web browser) sends a request to the server. This request usually includes:

* Endpoint: The URL where the API can be accessed.
* Method: The type of action you want to perform (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* Headers: Additional information sent with the request (e.g., authentication tokens).
* Body: The data sent with the request (for methods like POST or PUT).
* Response: The server processes the request and sends back a response. This response typically includes:
* Status Code: Indicates the result of the request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).
* Headers: Additional information about the response.
* Body: The data returned by the server (usually in JSON format).

## Example Interaction
Imagine you want to get a list of users from a server:

Request: Your application sends a GET request to http://example.com/api/users.
Response: The server responds with a list of users in JSON format.

  { "id": 1, "name": "Alice" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Bob" }

## Types of APIs
## REST (Representational State Transfer)
Most Common: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Stateless: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
## SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
Older Protocol: Uses XML for message format and can be more complex.
Highly Secure: Often used in enterprise-level applications where security and transaction management are crucial.
## GraphQL
Newer Query Language: Allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
Flexible: Reduces the amount of data transferred over the network by allowing more specific queries.

## Key Benefits of APIs
* Efficiency: APIs can be used to automate tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention.
* Innovation: APIs allow developers to access and integrate new technologies and services easily.
* Collaboration: Different teams can work on different parts of a system simultaneously, improving productivity and innovation.

## Setting Up the Project
To create the project directory structure and set up a virtual environment, run the following commands in your VScode command line git bash or powershell:

## To open up your terminal in VScode
* Use the shortcut "Ctrl + ` " (backtick key). - Windows users
* Use the shortcut "Cmd + ` " (backtick key). - Mac user
Option 2: Click on the Terminal option in the top menu and select New Terminal.

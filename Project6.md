## What is an API?
## Definition
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. Think of it as a messenger that takes requests and tells a system what you want to do, then returns the response back to you.

## Everyday Examples
* Weather Apps: When you check the weather on your phone, the app sends a request to a weather service API, which then sends back the weather data.
* Social Media Sharing: When you share a YouTube video on Facebook, an API allows Facebook to access the YouTube video data and display it on your timeline.
* Online Payments: When you buy something online, an API allows the online store to communicate with your bank to process the payment.
